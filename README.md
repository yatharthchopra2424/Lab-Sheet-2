## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the repository**:
    On the terminal, copy and paste the following command

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aryan-Dot-Dev/Lab-Sheet-2
   ```
   
2. **Compile the Code**:
    Use javac to create Class Files for all Java files.
    All the code is compiled in out/src and out/test directories
    ```bash
    javac -d out source/TwoDimensionalArray.java test/TwoDimensionalArrayTest.java
    javac -d out source/StringAlgorithms.java test/StringAlgorithmsTest.java
    ```

3. **Run the Code**:
    Use java command to run files individually.
    ```bash
    java -cp out test.TwoDimensionalArrayTest
    java -cp out test.StringAlgorithmsTest
    ```

## Repository Overview

1.  All the Java Class files are stored in the ```source``` directory

2. All the TestFiles which will be used to run the program to check test-cases are stored in ```test``` directory

3. After all the javac commands have been executed, all new files will be stored in ```out/source``` and ```out/test``` directory, and will be used to execute the program.
